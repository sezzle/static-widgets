## Other Products in this Project

The following products are included in the static-widgets project because, like the core product, these are installed so all code is housed within your store's theme. However, each is a distinct product with its own purpose and installation instructions.

**<a href="https://github.com/sezzle/static-widgets/blob/production/src/sezzle-shopify-buy-static-widget/sezzle-shopify-buy-static-widget.html" >Sezzle Shopify Buy Static Widget</a>**

The Sezzle Shopify Buy static widget is a lightweight version of our static widget. Shopify Buy product details are rendered within an iframe on the non-Shopify storefront, which is not compatible with either the standard widget script nor the regular static widget product.<br/>

**<a href="https://github.com/sezzle/static-widgets/tree/production/src/sezzle-checkout-button" >Sezzle Shopify Checkout Button</a>**

The Sezzle Checkout button is installed on the Shopify cart page to bypass third-party checkouts such as Carthook, Zipify, or Bold Commerce by redirecting the customer to the Shopify Native checkout. Further, if a user is logged into Shop Pay but wishes to checkout with Sezzle, this button will not redirect automatically to the Shop Pay experience.<br/>

Sezzle does not offer an express checkout option at this time. This banner clarifies to the customer that Sezzle can be selected on the Payments page of the non-express checkout flow.
